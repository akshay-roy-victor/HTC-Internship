    "The two cells below are codes in python used to arrange the image files provided into a organized manner. Image files will first be separated based on whether the cheque image is showing the front or the rear end. Then for each of the front and the rear images, they will be sorted into subsequent folders based on their format, for example: jpg, tif, bmp, etc. os library is used for file reading/manipulation and shutil library is used for file moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first cell, the code first makes two folders to store front and rear images. If the front and rear folder is already made the code will catch an exception and notify that the folders have already been made.. Then the split function is used from the os library and stores the array in a variable, next a conditional statement is used to check if the array contains 'front' or 'rear' in the name of the file to then sort it to its respective folder. If all the files have already been sorted, the loop ends, the exception is caught, and the code notifies that all the files have been moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second cell, the code is similar to the first cell, however the sorting is made into a function, and that function is used on both the 'front' and 'rear' folders. File names are split and extensions are matched into their respective folders."
